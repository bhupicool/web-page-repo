	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<P>What types of people are visiting your About Us page?  Who are they? Most likely, they’re prospective customers considering the purchase of your products or services.

They’re trying to determine if they can trust you.  They want to peek behind the curtain and see if your company is one they’d like to do business with.  They seek answers to questions like these:

Is this a big company or small?
Is it a public company, private or family-owned business?
How long have you been in business?
Who’s at the helm?
Where are you based?
What makes your company special?
What are its core values?
Why should I buy from you and not from your competitor?
</P>
